#  Temperature Control System Using PIC16F877A
🚀 Temperature Control System Using PIC16F877A



## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **temperature monitoring and control system** using a **PIC16F877A** microcontroller. It reads temperature data from an **LM35** sensor and displays it on an **LCD screen**. The system allows the user to set a target temperature using buttons, activating a fan or alert system when necessary.
